# Jump-and-Hover

This is my second year final project coded in C++ using Box2d and SFML.

It's a remake of a small platform game called Jump and Hover which you have to use the players' feature of levitation In order to overcome obstacles and reach the end of the level.

A short demo of the game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqNthJpcB2c&ab_channel=ElemenTal
