# Jump & Hover

This is my second year final project coded in C++ using Box2d and SFML.

It's a remake of a small platform game called "Jump and Hover" which you 
have to use the player's feature of levitation in order to overcome obstacles and reach the end of the level.

The game has an implementation of design patterns such as Singleton, Factory and MultiMethods.
